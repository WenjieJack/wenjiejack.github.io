About Me
======
I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Utah State University, Logan, UT. My advisor is [Dr. Wen Li](https://awen-li.github.io/). I received my B.S. in CS from Washington State University, Pullman, WA. The primary focus of our research lab, the Advancing Scalable Security Lab, includes software security, software engineering, and network security and privacy.
